## Diesel vs. Electric: Shifting Trends in New Car Registrations in Sweden! 🚗⚡️🌱 

I'm thrilled to share with you a project that I've been passionately working on—analyzing newly registered cars in Sweden, from 2006 to May 2023. Throughout this project, I delved into the depths of SQL, Excel, and primarily Power BI, unraveling valuable insights about the evolving automotive landscape and the surge in sustainable transportation solutions. 🌍

5 quick facts:

🔌 Electric vehicles (EVs) have proven to be the most fascinating fuel type in the latest trend, and their popularity started to surge as early as 2018. Over the following four years, their registrations increased by an impressive 1245.5%. On the other hand, diesel vehicles have shown a declining trend since 2018, with a decrease of 73.23% during the same period.

🔋 An important aspect of the so-called bonus-malus system, implemented on July 1, 2018, is the significant increase in the number of newly registered electric cars during this period.

🌱 In 2021, electric cars accounted for 18% of all newly registered cars, doubling their share since 2020.

🏆 In 2022, Region Halland had the highest proportion of newly registered electric cars in the whole of Sweden, with an impressive 36.4%. This places Halland County at the forefront of electric car registrations during that year.

🚗 Diesel cars accounted for 12.3% of new registrations in 2022, while electric cars reached an impressive 32.1%! This indicates a clear trend towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly vehicle fleet. The popularity of electric cars now surpasses that of diesel cars, which is a positive sign for Sweden's green transition.

## The Increasing Popularity of Electric Cars

The rising popularity of electric cars can be attributed to several factors:

- **Better Battery Technology**: Advancements in battery technology have made electric cars more affordable and accessible to a wider audience.

- **Growing Charging Infrastructure**: The increasing number of charging stations has made it easier and more convenient to charge electric vehicles, addressing range anxiety concerns.

- **Government Support**: Various government incentives and policies, such as the bonus-malus system, have encouraged the adoption of electric cars and contributed to their growth.

- **Environmental Consciousness**: There is a growing number of environmentally conscious individuals who recognize the importance of reducing carbon emissions and want to make a positive impact by choosing electric vehicles.

Electric cars have become a symbol of sustainable transportation and are playing a crucial role in shaping the future of the automotive industry. Their eco-friendly nature and technological advancements make them an attractive choice for both consumers and policymakers alike. As these trends continue, electric vehicles are expected to have an even greater impact on the global automotive landscape.

🚗 Analyzing Newly Registered Cars in Sweden: An Electric Journey 🌱

I'm thrilled to share with you a project that I've been passionately working on—analyzing newly registered cars in Sweden, with a particular emphasis on electric vehicles (EVs). 📈⚡️

Throughout this project, I delved into the depths of SQL, Excel, and primarily Power BI, unraveling valuable insights about the evolving automotive landscape and the surge in sustainable transportation solutions. 🌍

The main objective of this project was to comprehensively understand the current trends, patterns, and adoption rates of EVs in Sweden. By leveraging a combination of robust data analysis techniques and visually appealing dashboards, I've strived to present the findings in a clear and concise manner. 📊
